## iOS Track

CS50 gives you 4 options to choose from for the final track of your studies and your final project:
- Web
- Games
- Mobile: Android
- Mobile: iOS

I choose `iOS`. The reasons for this being:
- I have a lot of experience in Web, having spend my whole career so far working on this, so I wanted to take something new and challenging.
- I did not wanted to take the Android track, because it is in Java. I have a fair amount of experience in Java with web,
and regarding Android Kotlin is the (not so) new cool kid on the block.
- I have some familiarity with iOS, because I took a course in Telerik academy a few years back. I found it interesting, but never build on that knowledge and
am still having feelings of something unfinished.
- Had it not been for that, I probably would have picked the Games one, as gaming is my passion.
